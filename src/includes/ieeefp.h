 *
 * There are five floating-point exceptions, which can be individually
 * ENABLED (== 1) or DISABLED (== 0).  When an exception occurs
 * (ENABLED or not), the fact is noted by changing an associated
 * "sticky bit" from CLEAR (==0) to SET (==1).
 *
 * NOTE: the bit positions in an fp_except are chosen to match that in
 * the MAU and the FPA hardware mask bits.

 * (if both underflow and inexact are generated, _fpftype is underflow)
 * and _fpfault points to all the other information needed.
 * Two integer faults also use this mechanism: "integer overflow" and
 * "integer divide by zero". If either of these faults is indicated,
 * or if _fpftype == UNKNOWN, _fpfault will be NULL.

 * which checks to see if a single-precision number is a NaN,

 * passed.  The following macro simulates a function which returns

/* FULL EXCEPTION ENVIRONMENT CONTROL ************************
 *
 * The complete exception environment defined above requires
 * a significant amount of code to be picked up from the libraries.
 * The "glue" routines _getfltsw() and _getflthw() are provided
 * in two versions, one with full capability and one without.
 * The version without full capability has the following behavior:
 *	floating-point faults will raise SIGFPE, but
 *	the user handler will have _fpftype == UNKNOWN, and
 *	_fpfault == NULL. If SIGFPE is set to SIG_DFL, a core dump
 *	will be produced.
 * If ANY module in the final a.out #includes ieeefp.h (except as noted
 * below), the code below will force in the FULL environment,
 * 
 * NOTES: 1) code in the library (e.g. for setround(), etc.) which
 *	needs the definitions above, but does not care which fault
 *	environment is picked up SHOULD #define P754_NOFAULT
 *	before #including ieeefp.h.
 *	2) If a user program does not wish to do any fault recovery,
 *	just produce a core dump, it MAY also #define P754_NOFAULT,
 *	and may gain a code size reduction. However, if it uses a
 *	routine	in the math library that does request the full fault
 *	environment then the full environment WILL be included.
